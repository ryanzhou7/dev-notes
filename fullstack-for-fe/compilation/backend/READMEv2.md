# TinyUrl clone

## Spec

1. A user can submit a "long" url to get a shortened url
2. When that shortened url is pasted into the browser the browser will be redirected to the original "long" url site

## Versions

- This codebase incrementally improves all versions of the code are active at the same time
- As to not repeat code, some improvements will require commenting/uncommenting edits

## Setup

- Clone this repo
- `cd backend`
  - the root of this codebase
- `python3 -m venv venv`
  - Create a python virtual environment (v-env)
- `. venv/bin/activate`
  - Activate that venv, if you run `which pip` it should point to `<path_of_venv>/bin/pip`
- `pip install -e .`
  - -e Tells pip to find setup.py in the current directory and install it in editable or development mode. Editable mode means that as you make changes to your local code, youâ€™ll only need to re-install if you change the metadata about the project, such as its dependencies.
- `export FLASK_APP=flaskr && export FLASK_DEBUG=true && flask run`
  - We need to tell flask where our python module code is, the `__init__.py` file makes /flaskr a module
  - By enabling debug mode, the server will automatically reload if code changes, and will show an interactive debugger in the browser if an error occurs during a request.
- Visit `localhost:5000` in browser
  - Should return "Hello, World!"
- In Vscode download the Python extension by Microsoft
- Alternatively, to run with pycharm
  - Top right -> Edit configurations -> flask server
  - Target type [X], script path, select `flaskr/wsgi.py`
  - FLASK_ENV = development, FLASK_DEBUG [X]

## General notes

- When running the `flaskr/wsgi.py` the `__init__.py` will run prior. Note the single global `app` instance that will be used throughout the other parts of the code
  - Ex. in `wsgi.py` note `@app.route("/")`
  - This says, create a GET(default) route that just returns a 200 status + text
- **Templates**: files that contain static data as well as placeholders for dynamic data. A template is rendered with specific data to produce a final document
  - [Dynamic data example](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/tutorial/templates/#id1)
  - Flask renders (fills out the dynamic parts of the template) prior to return this view to the client
  - All templates reside in the /templates folder by default
- **Blueprints**: a way to organize a group of related views and other code. Rather than registering views and other code directly with an application, they are registered with a blueprint
  - Typically used to organize features, [ex. register and login](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/tutorial/views/) but we use it to organize our code versions, i.e. v1, v2, etc...
  - Views of a feature often resides in its own /feature_name sub-folder in templates but all our code versions use the same index.html view
- All routes of the blueprint must be "loaded" prior to registration

## V1

- Uses an url.json file for storing the urls
- Browse `localhost:5000/v1/urls/`, submit an url, and ensure the app works

## V2

- Uses a Sqlite, an SQL database engine meant to run on devices such as mobile phones, as opposed meant running on a server by itself
